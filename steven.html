          <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
          The purpose of this graph was designed to show the number of life endangering alarms run in San Francisco from January 2019 to December 2019.
          From this graph, we can see a trend in the amount of life threatening alarms called through the year.
                </p>

        <h2 id="data">Data</h2>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Number of Alarms </strong> The number of alarms.</li>

          <li><strong>Month of Year: </strong> The month in the year of 2019</li>

          <li><strong>Call Group Type: </strong> Choosing the option -> "Potentially Life Threatening" only</li>

          <!-- <li><strong>Year:</strong> Year of the game's release.</li>
          <li><strong>Genre:</strong> different type of games.</li> -->
        </ol>


        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <p> The color of line indicates that we are only looking at Potentially Life Threatening calls. We can understand the number of life Threatening alarms is at its peak towards the end of year from the obseravable trend in the graph.</p>

        <p> All the data warngling for prototypes are in Tableau: </p>
        <p> For the heatmap, the Year columns were filtered to only show the data of every 5 years since 1985; platform was filtered to only show famous home video game consoles.</p> -->

        <!-- <p> From the pie charts, we can see that when a console is relatively new to the market, only a few publishers are producing games for that platform, and in 5 years, the publishers could increase largely. </p>
        <p> Comprehensively, from the coloring in the heatmap and numbers of categories in pie chart, we can see the most way of playing games at home consoles: for example, at year of 2000, Sony's PlayStaion was dominating the market with large amount of sales and various of publishers of game on it. Soon as 2005, PlayStation2 took over and PlayStation is not in the map anymore;
          also in the year of 2005 the x360 appears but only had 8 publishers for games on it. In the year of 2010, x360 was selling better and is really close to PlayStation3's sales, but wii was far more popular than PlayStation and x360... It is interesting to see how the gaming consoles come and go and how their companies present new products in the competition.</p> -->
          <!-- <h3>Shared processing or filtering: </h3>
            <p>Possible ways of grouping: by sales in different regions(global, North America, Europe, Japan and other regions), or by published years, or by gaming platform, or by publishers. All the filtering could be done in main-stream data handling softwares.</p> -->

             <h3> Data Wrangling</h3>
             <p>
               To cut the huge dataset down I decided to only use the cases in highest seriousness: Potentially Life Threatening Alarms.
               Since this graph analyzes cases in 2019, I only used data from the year 2019.
             </p>


        <h3 width="30" height="30">Connection to project themes</h3>
    <p>The visualization chart on this page demonstrates how many of the most serious cases are happening every month in San Fracisco. It is important to note that, it is impossible to predict for sure when we will
      need more firefighters and when we will not, this graph could help estimate when more firefighters will be needed and when are less needed.
